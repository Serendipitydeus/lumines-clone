### Functionality

1. Players will be able to start and reset a game board

2. Players will be able to move 2x2 square pieces across a board and place them freely while having the option to rotate them to match the colors accordingly.

3. Players will be able to create 2x2 or greater squares of the same color as a sweeper deletes these squares. A combo multiplier will track how many squares were deleted and add an appropriate amount of points to the player's current score.

4. The in-game sweeper will move based on the speed of the music, faster music, faster sweeper, and vice versa.

### Future Features

1. Adjust the speed of the sweeper based on the speed and rhythm of the music

2. Add animated backgrounds and pieces that change with the music (themes)

### Technologies Used

1. Javascript - will handle the main game logic

2. Three.js/Canvas - will handle the rendering and effects of the pieces and the gameboard

3. Webpack - will handle the bundling of the JS files.

### WireFrame

The app will consist of a single page that will render the game board in the center while tracking the player's current level, current score, and the most recent high score on the right. The left side of the game board will consist of a place for the following pieces that will render to appear for the player to use. The bottom of the game board will consist of a Github link and a LinkedIn link.
